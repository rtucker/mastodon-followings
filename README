INSTALLATION
============

Go to Settings -> Development, create a new application:
    Application name:       mastodon-followings
    Application website:    https://github.com/rtucker/mastodon-followings
    Minimum required scopes:

        write:blocks write:follows

Install the dependencies for this script:
    pipenv install
    cp settings.py.example settings.py
    # then edit settings.py to have the correct stuff

Then run it:
    pipenv run python followings.py --help

EXAMPLE USAGES
==============

Note: omitting the "--unfollow" in the below examples will do a "dry run,"
      allowing you to make sure everything is going to be alright.

Unfollow accounts which have not tooted in six months:
    pipenv run python followings.py --min-activity=6m [--unfollow]

Remove followers who haven't tooted in a year:
    pipenv run python followings.py --followers [--unfollow]

Remove followers who you aren't following:
    pipenv run python followings.py --unmutuals [--unfollow]
